# Welcome

Welcome to the team! Here at the Digital Enablement Division @TBS we are working to build the new Open and Accessible Digital Workspace (OADW). Our main role as the data team is to provide valuable insights to team members in order to drive better decision making. We've also historically gone above and beyond to research new technologies and implement machine learning algorithms using the mass of data collected by our platforms.

# The tools we use 

In order to traverse the large amount of data we house, we need to make use of modern tools. 

In terms of programing languages we are currently using:
- Python
- Javascript (nodejs)
- React (JSX)
- Typescript (Soon to replace most of our vanilla js code)

At the moment we are currently developing mostly in nodejs for our backend solutions as well as creating visualizations programatically using React with libraries like [plotly.js](https://plot.ly/javascript/). If you don't have much experience with nodejs you need not worry, experience with at least one higher level language like python and a lower level like C++ (or java) are more than enough to make it very easy to pickup.

A few useful skillsets to have at your disposal are:
- Good understanding of Graphql and SQL (most important but will come naturally from work experience)
- Experience using R & RStudio
- Pandas and Numpy experience
- Matplotlib
- Excel
- Regex
- Scikit-learn
- Any Deep Learning framework (pytorch, tensorflow...)

Other than the core programming skills and method of thinking, it is not important to be an expert in any or all of these topics (it's a lot of stuff!). It is more important to have just enough experience to know which tool is the best for the job and use that experience to go read the documentation once more. 

## Theory

#### Statisitics

A good understanding of the statistical concepts will be very useful. 

- Bernoulli trial
- Binomial distribution
- Bayes Theorem
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- etc...

#### Linear Algebra / Calculus

A good understanding of linear algebra, especially Matrix Calculus is very helpful for understanding the components which power machine learning systems. I won't list anything specific; however, just be ready to open a textbook to figure something out. 

#### Machine Learning

A good understanding of the basic concepts of machine learning such as test/train splits, loss functions, objective functions is useful. Understanding of neural networks, sigmoids/ReLU etc... is also a plus. 

#### Recommender Systems

[This paper gives a really good overview.](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds/ch9.pdf)

#### Natural Language Processing

*I may ommit this completely from on-boarding as there is already a lot of things in here.*
